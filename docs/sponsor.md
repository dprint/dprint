# Sponsor

A lot of time and effort has gone into creating dprint.

If you are using it in a commercial environment then it is strongly recommended you support the project financially.

## How much is dprint worth to your company?

Think about the cost savings from the following:

1. How much time will your developers save auto-formatting their code?
2. How much time will your team save not making and acting on code formatting related comments on code reviews?
3. If you are checking formatting on your CI, how much time will your CI runs save checking formatting with dprint compared to other formatters? Remember dprint is lightning fast.

If you see the benefit, please spend the time to pass along a small fraction of that cost savings to support this project.
